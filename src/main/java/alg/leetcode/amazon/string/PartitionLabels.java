/**
 * Input: S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
 * Output: [9,7,8]
 * Explanation:
 * The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
 * This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
 * A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits S into less parts.
