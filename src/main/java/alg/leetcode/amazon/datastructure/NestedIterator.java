/**
 *Input: [[1,1],2,[1,1]]
 * Output: [1,1,2,1,1]
 * Explanation: By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false,
 *              the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,1,2,1,1].
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: [1,[4,[6]]]
 * Output: [1,4,6]
 * Explanation: By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false,
 *              the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,4,6].
